# TODO

- [x] make a node.js translation of gpxConsolidatorPy using a Factory Function pattern adaptable to script tags for an index html 

    createGpxProcessor kind of does this now

- [ ] actually test it

- [ ] make some functions to make data tractable to leaflet.js - there has to be a geojson intermediary between the parsing/filtering of the gpx and the creation of a gpx download if we're going to use this in browser

## gpx consolidator scripts

folks have to fiddle with mapsource when they come in from the field but they often all do things a little differently

### gpxConsolidatorPy

a python script makes the consolidation of gpx files uniform

### gpxConsolidatorJs

the js script is intended for use in a script tag of some static site index.html for folks to run scripts if they dont have python

### staticSiteConsolidator

a handy index.html for wirepullers to consolidate gpx files without using python or node

## lost wirepuller

wirepuller starcraft POC

## notes on node version

use nvm to control local node version. This project uses node 22

make sure you have a folder ./26-Aug-25 with gpx files in it first
```
python consolidator.py --input ./26-Aug-25 --output Aug26.gpx --filter-date 2025-08-26 --start-time 06:00 --end-time 20:00
```
# TODO

- [ ] test waypoints consolidation (it should work ...) 
- [ ] track colours would be nice
- [ ] it would be cool to have routes and route filtering algo
